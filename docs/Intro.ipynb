    "\n",
    "### Use online notes\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to use these notes is to [read the documents online](https://geog0027-environmental-remote-sensing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use github notes\n",
    "\n",
    "The main store for these notes is on [gitbub](https://github.com/profLewis/GEOG0027) and you shpuld always be able to access (or download) the notes from there.\n",

    "\n",
    "Thius lets you *run* the notebooks, rather than just viewing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Python locally\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the notes as a notebook (assuming you have [`git`](http://git-scm.com) and [python](http://continuum.io/downloads) on your computer):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Copy all of the notes to your local computer (**if for the first time**)\n",
    "\n",
    "        mkdir -p ~/DATA/working\n",
